OPERATING SYSTEM

What is OS ?
An operating system (OS) is the software that manages all the hardware and software resources of a computer. Think of it as the brain of the computer, acting as a mediator between you (the user) and the computer's hardware. Without an OS, you wouldn't be able to run programs, save files, or even see anything on your screen.

What is Linux ?
Linux is a family of open-source, Unix-like operating systems. It's not a single product like Windows or macOS, but rather a core component—the Linux kernel—that is the foundation for a wide range of operating systems. These full operating systems, which bundle the Linux kernel with other software and utilities, are known as Linux distributions (or "distros").
